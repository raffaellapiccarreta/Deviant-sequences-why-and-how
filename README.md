# Deviant-sequences-why-and-how
Here you find the material to reproduce the figures in the paper  *Identifying and Qualifying Deviant Cases in Clusters of Sequences: The Why and The How*. Eur J Population 40, 1 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10680-023-09682-3

If you use the code in here  (and we are happy if you do so) please **cite the paper**.

In this folder you find a dataframe used to describe the functions to flag and graphically display deviant sequences, the R script with the functions and a pdf providing a step by step description of the procedure illustrated in our paper.
